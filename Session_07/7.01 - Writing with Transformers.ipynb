Dr. Jorge P√©rez, an evolutionary biologist from the University of La Paz, and several companions, were exploring the Andes Mountains when they found a small valley, with no other animals or humans. P√©rez noticed that the valley had what appeared to be a natural fountain, surrounded by two peaks of rock and silver snow. P√©rez and the others then ventured further into the valley. ‚ÄúBy the time we reached the top of one peak, the water looked blue, with some crystals on top,‚Äù said P√©rez. P√©rez and his friends were astonished to see the unicorn herd.
