    "\n",
    "<p>In this lesson, we will start experimenting with so-called artificial neural networks (ANNs). Neural networks are a class of machine learning algorithms that can provide you with extremely powerful models and are, as a result, a great addition to your machine learning toolbox. ANNs are known as universal function approximators &mdash; i.e., they are capable of representing and approximating almost any arbitrary function, and that, regardless of the complexity. Self-driving cars, voice assistants, and modern medical imagery systems are all modern examples of what artifical neural networks can do. Even though artifical neural networks can be extremely powerful, it is important to keep in mind that they do not provide a one-size-fits-all solution out of the box.</p>\n",

As shown below, a single-layer perceptron consists of a set of input features ($x_{n}$) and their corresponding weights ($w_{n}$) as well as a threshold function (a.k.a. step function).

This is one of the main assumptions that needs to be made when dealing with gradient descent and the reason why backpropagation is used to optimise neural networks. By backpropagating the error through a network &mdash; i.e., from output to input &mdash; we can fine-tune the model's weights and biases based on their effect on the cost function.</p>\n",
